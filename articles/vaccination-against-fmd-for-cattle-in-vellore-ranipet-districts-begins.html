    <p>As part of the ongoing efforts to protect cattle from Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), a vaccination drive has been initiated in Vellore and Ranipet districts. This crucial initiative aims to safeguard the health and well-being of cattle in the region, ensuring their long-term productivity and sustainability.</p>

    <h2>Key Highlights of the Vaccination Drive:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mass vaccination campaign targeting cattle in Vellore and Ranipet districts</li>
        <li>Deployment of trained veterinary professionals to administer vaccines</li>
        <li>Collaboration between local authorities and veterinary departments for effective implementation</li>
        <li>Use of high-quality vaccines to ensure maximum protection against FMD</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The vaccination drive is a crucial step in the prevention of FMD, a highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. The disease not only poses a significant risk to the health of livestock but also has economic implications for farmers and the dairy industry.</p>

    <p>By vaccinating cattle against FMD, farmers can reduce the risk of disease outbreaks, minimize economic losses, and ensure the overall health and productivity of their livestock. Additionally, vaccination plays a key role in preventing the spread of the disease within the community, protecting both animals and humans from potential transmission.</p>

    <h2>Importance of Timely Vaccination:</h2>
    <p>Timely vaccination is essential to build immunity against FMD and prevent the onset of the disease. By following the recommended vaccination schedule and guidelines provided by veterinary experts, farmers can ensure that their cattle receive the necessary protection against FMD.</p>

    <p>It is important to note that vaccination against FMD should be carried out by trained professionals using approved vaccines to ensure its effectiveness. Farmers are advised to consult with local veterinary authorities for guidance on vaccination procedures and best practices.</p>

    <h2>FAQs:</h2>

    <h3>1. How often should cattle be vaccinated against FMD?</h3>
    <p>Cattle should be vaccinated against FMD at regular intervals as recommended by veterinary experts. Typically, a yearly vaccination schedule is followed to maintain immunity levels and prevent disease outbreaks.</p>

    <h3>2. Are there any side effects of FMD vaccination for cattle?</h3>
    <p>FMD vaccines are generally safe for cattle and do not cause significant side effects. However, mild reactions such as local swelling or fever may occur in some cases. It is important to monitor cattle post-vaccination and consult a veterinarian if any unusual symptoms are observed.</p>
