<p>When it comes to our health, there are certain organs that play a crucial role in keeping our bodies functioning properly. One such organ is the liver. As the largest internal organ, the liver performs a variety of essential functions that are vital to our overall well-being. To shed light on the importance of this powerhouse organ, here are 9 things about the liver that a Harvard doctor wants everyone to know.</p>

<h2>4. Alcohol and the Liver</h2>
<p>Excessive alcohol consumption can damage the liver and lead to serious health complications, such as alcoholic liver disease. It's important to drink alcohol in moderation to protect the liver.</p>

<h2>5. Liver Transplants</h2>

<h2>6. Liver Cancer</h2>

<h2>8. Liver Function Tests</h2>
<p>Liver function tests are blood tests that can assess the health of the liver. These tests measure levels of certain enzymes and proteins in the blood that indicate liver function.</p>

<h2>9. Liver Health and Hydration</h2>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Q: How often should I get my liver function tested?</h3>
