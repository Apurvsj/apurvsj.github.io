  Title: The Unexpected and Unwanted Side Effects of Over-Indulging in Green Tea

Have you ever heard the old saying, 'too much of a good thing can be bad?' Well, this adage holds true even when it comes to our beloved green tea. Despite the multitude of health benefits that green tea boasts, consuming it in excessive amounts can lead to a handful of unpleasant side effects. In this post, we'll explore the darker side of our favorite antioxidant-rich brew. 

Before we dive in, let's be clear: this isn't a declaration against green tea. Moderate consumption of green tea can help with everything from weight loss to improved brain function. But as with most things in life, balance is key. Now, without further ado, let's explore what happens when you have too much green tea.

## Nausea and Digestive Discomfort

Hereâ€™s a bitter truth: consuming an excess of green tea can disrupt your stomach's peace. Green tea contains tannins, which can increase stomach acid, leading to feelings of nausea or a stomach ache. Overdoing your green tea intake might also cause:

- Acid reflux
- Constipation
- Diarrhea

Remember, moderation is the key to enjoying the benefits of green tea without suffering from these adverse effects.

## Sleep Disruptions

If your sleep schedule has been off-kilter lately, your green tea habit might be to blame. Here's why:

- Green tea contains caffeine, which can disrupt your sleep patterns if consumed late in the day.
- A study published in Sleep Medicine Reviews highlights how excessive caffeine can lead to insomnia.

If you're a green tea enthusiast who values their sleep, consider cutting off your consumption a few hours before bed.

## Iron Absorption

Surprisingly, excessive green tea can interfere with the bodyâ€™s absorption of iron. This is because it contains a catechin called EGCG, which binds to iron. If you're drinking six or more cups a day, you might be putting yourself at risk for iron deficiency anemia. 

## Dizziness and Headaches

While a warm cup of green tea can feel soothing, too much can cause you to feel dizzy or even trigger a headache. This is primarily due to:

- Dehydration caused by caffeine.
- Abrupt caffeine withdrawal if you're used to large quantities of green tea.

If you notice any of these side effects, consider scaling back on your green tea consumption.

## Irregular Heartbeat and Blood Pressure Issues

Overconsumption of green tea can affect heart health due to its caffeine content. It can cause:

- Irregular heartbeat 
- Increased heart rate
- High blood pressure

The American Heart Association suggests moderation in caffeine consumption to maintain heart health. 

## Bottom Line: Balance is Key

"Green tea is a source of nutrients that help you in many ways. But like everything else, it should be consumed in moderate quantities," says nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar. It's recommended to limit your green tea intake to between 2-3 cups a day. 

Remember, everyoneâ€™s tolerance to caffeine varies. Some might feel the side effects after one cup, others after five. Listen to your body and adjust accordingly. After all, we drink green tea for its benefits, not its side effects.
