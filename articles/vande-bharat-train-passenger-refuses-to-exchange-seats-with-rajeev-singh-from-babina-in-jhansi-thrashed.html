The passenger, whose identity remains undisclosed, was reportedly approached by Rajeev Singh, requesting a swap of seats. Upon refusal, the situation escalated into violence.<br><br>Key events:<br>1. The incident took place on the Delhi-Varanasi route when Singh, as per witnesses, asked the passenger to exchange seats.<br>2.

Within minutes, the verbal spat turned physical, leading to Singh allegedly assaulting the passenger.<br>4. Fellow travellers quickly intervened, pulling Singh away and alerting the train officials.<br>5. The Railway Protection Force (RPF) was immediately informed about the incident.<br><br>While the passenger suffered minor injuries, Singh was detained by the RPF at the next station. An investigation is underway, and charges are expected to be filed against Singh for instigating violence and causing harm to a fellow passenger.<br><br>This incident has led to calls for stricter enforcement of onboard rules and etiquette on Indian trains.
