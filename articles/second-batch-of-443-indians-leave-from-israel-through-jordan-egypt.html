Introduction 

In recent news, a second group of 443 Indian nationals have left Israel through Jordan and Egypt, signaling a significant step towards the repatriation of Indian citizens stranded in the Middle East due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This blog article provides an in-depth account of this exodus, exploring key facts, and the intricacies involved in this mammoth task.

Key Details of the Exodus

The Indian Embassy in Israel spearheaded this operation, in collaboration with the embassies in Jordan and Egypt. Here are some significant highlights:
