<p>On World Brain Health Day, Karnataka announces a new approach to stroke management and head injury care. The state will implement a 'hub-and-spoke' model to ensure every patient receives timely and quality treatment. This innovative approach aims to improve outcomes for patients with brain-related conditions across the state.</p>

<h2>The 'Hub-and-Spoke' Model</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Under this model, specialized hubs will be established in major cities, equipped with advanced medical facilities and expert healthcare professionals.</li>
  <li>Patients with complex conditions such as strokes or head injuries will be referred to these hubs for specialized treatment.</li>
  <li>Spoke centers, located in smaller towns and villages, will provide initial assessment and stabilization before transferring patients to the hubs if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>This model ensures that patients receive appropriate care at the right time, reducing the risk of complications and improving outcomes. By centralizing expertise and resources in hub centers, Karnataka aims to provide world-class healthcare services to all its residents.</p>

  <li>Improved access to specialized care for patients in remote areas</li>
  <li>Enhanced coordination between healthcare facilities for better patient outcomes</li>
  <li>Efficient use of resources and expertise to optimize healthcare delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach not only benefits patients but also strengthens the overall healthcare system in Karnataka, setting a benchmark for quality care in brain health.</p>
