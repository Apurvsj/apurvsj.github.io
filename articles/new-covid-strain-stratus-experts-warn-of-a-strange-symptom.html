        <p>In recent weeks, health experts have raised concerns about a new variant of the COVID-19 virus named 'Stratus'. This strain has been found to exhibit a strange symptom that has puzzled scientists worldwide.</p>

        <h2>What is the strange symptom associated with the 'Stratus' strain?</h2>

        <p>Unlike other variants of the virus, patients infected with the 'Stratus' strain have reported experiencing sudden onset of anosmia, or loss of smell. This symptom has been observed in individuals with no history of smell-related issues, making it a unique characteristic of the 'Stratus' variant.</p>

        <h2>Experts' warning about the 'Stratus' strain</h2>

        <p>Health experts are urging the public to remain vigilant and monitor for any signs of anosmia, as it could be an early indicator of infection with the 'Stratus' strain. Early detection and prompt isolation of individuals showing this symptom are crucial in preventing the spread of the virus.</p>

        <h2>FAQs about the 'Stratus' variant</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Q: How does the loss of smell associated with the 'Stratus' strain differ from other COVID symptoms?</h3>
                <p>A: While loss of smell is a known symptom of COVID-19, the sudden onset of anosmia in individuals without prior smell-related issues is unique to the 'Stratus' variant.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Q: Are current vaccines effective against the 'Stratus' variant?</h3>
                <p>A: Preliminary studies suggest that existing vaccines offer some level of protection against the 'Stratus' strain. However, continued monitoring and research are needed to assess the full extent of vaccine efficacy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, the emergence of the 'Stratus' variant underscores the importance of ongoing vigilance and adherence to public health guidelines. By staying informed and following recommended safety measures, we can work together to combat the spread of COVID-19 and its variants.</p>
