<p>As the Delhi government recently announced a ban on the use of diesel generators and imposed restrictions on the use of personal vehicles in an effort to combat air pollution, questions have been raised about the fairness and effectiveness of these measures. One of the voices speaking out against these restrictions is that of an ex-Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot who questions why stringent regulations are being imposed on personal vehicles while older aircraft are still in operation.</p>

<h2>The Concerns of the Ex-IAF Pilot</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ex-IAF pilot, who has chosen to remain anonymous, expressed concerns about the disparity in treatment between personal vehicles and aircraft.</li>
<li>He highlighted the fact that the IAF still operates many aircraft that are more than 40 years old and are known to be major contributors to air pollution.</li>
<li>He argued that if the government is serious about tackling air pollution, it should also focus on addressing the emissions from older aircraft rather than solely targeting personal vehicles.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the ex-IAF pilot acknowledges the need for measures to reduce pollution levels in Delhi, he believes that the focus should be on a comprehensive approach that includes all sources of pollution, not just personal vehicles.</p>

<h2>The Reality of Air Pollution in Delhi</h2>
<p>Delhi has been grappling with severe air pollution for years, with levels of particulate matter and harmful gases exceeding safe limits. The city's air quality index often reaches hazardous levels, posing a serious threat to the health of its residents.</p>

<p>According to a report by the World Health Organization, Delhi is one of the most polluted cities in the world, with high levels of PM2.5 and PM10 particles causing respiratory problems and other health issues.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Q: Are personal vehicles the main contributors to air pollution in Delhi?</h3>
<p>A: While personal vehicles do contribute to air pollution in Delhi, other sources such as industrial emissions, construction activities, and agricultural burning also play a significant role in deteriorating air quality.</p>

<h3>Q: What steps is the Delhi government taking to address air pollution?</h3>
<p>A: In addition to the recent fuel ban and restrictions on personal vehicles, the Delhi government has implemented measures such as the Odd-Even scheme, tree plantation drives, and the introduction of electric buses to reduce air pollution in the city.</p>
