   <br/>
   <br/>
   Introduction:
   <br/>
   In a stirring display of industry unity, Aamir Khan Productions has publicly thanked the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) for standing in solidarity with their decision to not release the anticipated film "Sitaare Zameen Par" on Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Body:
   <br/>
   In the wake of the ongoing debate about the future of cinema in a digital era, Aamir Khan Productions has taken a firm stance in favour of traditional theatrical releases. This decision came to light with their upcoming film "Sitaare Zameen Par," which they have resolved to keep off OTT platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Key Points:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   1. **Aamir Khan Productions' Stand**: The production house expressed gratitude to the MAI for their support, emphasizing their shared belief in the unique and irreplaceable experience that a traditional theatre offers to moviegoers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   2. **Multiplex Association's Support**: The MAI has expressed its backing for Aamir Khan Productions, highlighting their own commitment to the theatrical experience. This support underscores the ongoing belief in the vitality and longevity of the cinema industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   3. **The Debate About OTT Releases**: The decision to keep "Sitaare Zameen Par" off OTT platforms comes amidst a growing trend of direct-to-digital releases, a move instigated by the Covid-19 pandemic. While this trend has been seen as a necessary adaptation to the pandemic situation, it has also sparked debates about the potential erosion of the traditional cinema experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   4. **The Future of "Sitaare Zameen Par"**: Aamir Khan Productions has assured fans and followers that "Sitaare Zameen Par" will have its grand release on the big screen, promising a cinematic experience that will be worth the wait.

   Conclusion:
   <br/>
   This move by Aamir Khan Productions, backed by the Multiplex Association of India, marks a significant moment in the ongoing dialogue about the future of cinema. It serves as a reminder that while digital platforms offer convenience and accessibility, the unmatched magic of watching a film in a theatre still holds a special place in the hearts of cinephiles. It remains to be seen how this decision will impact the wider industry trends, but for now, fans of Aamir Khan Productions can look forward to experiencing "Sitaare Zameen Par" the old-fashioned way - on the big screen.
