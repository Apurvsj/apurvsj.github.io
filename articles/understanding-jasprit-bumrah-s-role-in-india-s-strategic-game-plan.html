<p>When it comes to cricket, Jasprit Bumrah is a name that strikes fear into the hearts of batsmen around the world. His unique bowling style and ability to deliver yorkers with pinpoint accuracy make him a formidable force on the field. But what exactly is Bumrah's role in India's strategic game plan? Let's take a closer look.</p>

<h2>1. Bumrah as the Strike Bowler</h2>
